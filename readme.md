-> text is all p
    - Preheat your oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand up mixer, add the mashed bananas (over ripe bananas are best, mine weren't), a stick of butter, the honey, brown sugar, vanilla, eggs, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon powder and salt.
    - Using the paddle attachment on medium speed, mix all the ingredients together, till it's all combined. Don't worry too much if there are a few banana lumps here and there.
    - Add the flour and oats and barely mix it to come together. In fact you can just hand mix it.
    - Add 3/4 cup of the chopped walnuts and fold in with a spatula or wooden spoon. You really don't want to over beat this batter once you add the flour and oats to it, that's what keeps it moist and crumbly.
    - Pour the batter into a loaf tin and sprinkle the left over nuts & oats over the top.
    - Bake at 350F for 45-55 minutes. Check with a tooth pick to see if the bread is done. If the toothpick comes out clean after poking it through the center of the cake, it's done.
    - Take the cake out and let it cool for a 10 minutes, but you have to try a slice while it's still warm....and you have to try it with a little butter or honey yogurt....mmmmmm it just melts in your mouth! It's soooo good.
