    - skill level: easy
    - prep time: 15 mins
    - cooking time: 1 hr
    - total time: 1 hr 15 mins

- Ingredients
    - 3 ripe/over ripe bananas, mashed up
    - 1/2 cup butter (1 small stick)
    - 1/2 cup honey
    - 1/2 cup brown sugar
    - 1/2 tsp vanilla
    - 2 eggs (room temp)
    - 1/4 tsp baking soda
    - 1 tsp baking powder
    - 1/3 tsp cinnamon powder
    - 1/4 tsp salt
    - 1 1/4 cup flour
    - 1/2 cup oats
    - 1 cup chopped walnuts

- Directions	
    - Preheat your oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand up mixer, add the mashed bananas (over ripe bananas are best, mine weren't), a stick of butter, the honey, brown sugar, vanilla, eggs, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon powder and salt.
    - Using the paddle attachment on medium speed, mix all the ingredients together, till it's all combined. Don't worry too much if there are a few banana lumps here and there.
    - Add the flour and oats and barely mix it to come together. In fact you can just hand mix it.
    - Add 3/4 cup of the chopped walnuts and fold in with a spatula or wooden spoon. You really don't want to over beat this batter once you add the flour and oats to it, that's what keeps it moist and crumbly.
    - Pour the batter into a loaf tin and sprinkle the left over nuts & oats over the top.
    - Bake at 350F for 45-55 minutes. Check with a tooth pick to see if the bread is done. If the toothpick comes out clean after poking it through the center of the cake, it's done.
    - Take the cake out and let it cool for a 10 minutes, but you have to try a slice while it's still warm....and you have to try it with a little butter or honey yogurt....mmmmmm it just melts in your mouth! It's soooo good.
